### **LuxDevHQ AnalyticsChallenge102**

You are working as a data analyst at **Luxury Auto Kenya**, a car dealership company. You have a table named `cars` in the `inventory` schema that contains information about the vehicles in stock. Each record includes the `make`, `model`, `price_kes`, and other details. The table has **14 rows**, and the **top 3 most expensive cars** (Mercedes Gwagon, Toyota Land Cruiser V8, and BMW X5) all have the **same price of 12,500,000 KES**.

---

✅ **Task 1:**  
Write an SQL query to retrieve the **second highest distinct car price** from the `inventory.cars` table.

---

⚠️ **Note:**  
Since the top 3 cars have the **same highest price**, that price should **only count once**, and your query must return the **next highest unique price** (i.e., the **second distinct highest** price in the list).

---

✅ **Task 2:**  
Write an SQL query to find the model(s) that appear more than once in the dataset.
